SA-Investigator 2.0.0
11 February 2019

This add-on for Enterprise Security is designed to provide a set of dashboard/views that allow analysts to search for activity by a user account or asset(s) (including MAC address, hostname, IP address, NT-Hostname) or file/process name.

Various panels within these views require ES to be installed and if not, certain drill downs will fail and information such as notable events will not be viewable.

Searches leverage the accelerated data models and the default data models that are part of CIM and Enterprise Security.

This was built and tested on Splunk 7.2.0 and ES 5.2.  It should operate with no issues with Splunk 6.6.x and back to ES 4.7.x.

A few DNS panels leverage the Alexa - 1 Million, now deprecated and replaced by Cisco Umbrella - 1 Million List that comes with Enterprise Security. The URL Toolbox by Cedric Le Roux. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2734/ is also used for domain and url parsing in the DNS and Web sections. For those panels to operate as designed, URL Toolbox needs to be installed.
