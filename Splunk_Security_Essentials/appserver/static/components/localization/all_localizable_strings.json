Traditional POTS has conditioned people to expect immediate dial tone when picking up the phone and be intolerant of noise, echo or other problems that can plague IP telephony; as such, the systems and supporting infrastructure require careful monitoring and management to assure quality and reliability. Voice over IP protocol refers to several methods for transmitting real-time audio (and now video) information over an IP-based data network. Unlike traditional phone systems using dedicated, point-to-point circuits, VoIP applications use packet-based networks to carry real-time audio streams that are interspersed with other Ethernet data traffic. Since TCP packets may be delivered out of order due to data loss and retransmission, VoIP includes features to buffer and reassemble a stream. Similarly, VoIP packets are usually tagged with quality of service (QoS) headers to prioritize their delivery through the network."

While there are many approaches for doing that, a time honored way is to find weak passwords by just trying hundreds of common passwords. Particularly as most environments use Active Directory as their central storage respository for credentials, looking for brute force activity in Windows Security logs should be a component of any security strategy."

Here we look at two methods -- the first is to alert on any users for whom the number of searches in a short period is above a threshold, or if searches from multiple security domains fire in a short period of time. The second is to leverage just the numerical risk scores defined in the Risk Framework to show users who have bursty recent risk scores or consistent long term risk. These will detect users who have a large volume of suspicious behavior even in scenarios where there's not enough immediate risk to generate an alert to the SOC, preventing a slow and low threat from bypassing your detections.",

An example is a fully-usable piece of security content using Splunk’s detection abilities to assist you in securing your environment or hunting for potential evil. They can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with others, and in Splunk Enterprise (core) or with ES and UBA. We also map into the six stages that represent the Splunk Security Journey.</p>\n          <p>Each example includes sample data so that you can see what it does, after which you are encouraged to turn it loose on your own data! To help you better match the example to your environment, we have prerequisite checks and thorough documentation. The examples are also mapped to common frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;CK and a generic kill chain. You can save searches directly from this app to create Notable Events in ES, External Alarms in UBA, or simply kick off an alert action in Splunk Enterprise.</p>\n          <p>We recommend that to start you determine which of the six stages best represents where your organization is leveled today with Splunk. Next, you can click Security Content and explore the examples associated with that stage in the journey. The filters allow you to hone in on exactly the use cases, areas, and data sources that are applicable. And in case you forget, each page has a tour in the upper right that will walk you through all of the functionality!</p>",

To help you along the way, each example is documented so you can understand how it works, how to use it, and the level of difficulty. We’ve even provided data onboarding guides for some of the top data sources that feed these examples!</p>\n<p>What’s an example, you ask? An example is a fully-usable piece of security content using Splunk’s detection abilities to assist you in securing your environment or hunting for potential evil. They can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with others, and in Splunk Enterprise (core) or with ES and UBA. We also map into the six stages that represent the Splunk Security Journey.</p>\n<p>Each example includes sample data so that you can see what it does, after which you are encouraged to turn it loose on your own data! To help you better match the example to your environment, we have prerequisite checks and thorough documentation. The examples are also mapped to common frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;CK and a generic kill chain. You can save searches directly from this app to create Notable Events in ES, External Alarms in UBA, or simply kick off an alert action in Splunk Enterprise.</p>\n<p>We recommend that to start you determine which of the six stages best represents where your organization is leveled today with Splunk. Next, you can explore the examples associated with that stage in the journey. The filters allow you to hone in on exactly the use cases, areas, and data sources that are applicable. And in case you forget, each page has a tour in the upper right that will walk you through all of the functionality!</p>"
